        <p>
            Chicken Tikka Masala is a new food that I've had and I really enjoyed it. For those of you that have not tried it yet,
            I think that it's a great Indian dish and has introduced me to Indian food in general. Definitely a great way to mix
            up you typical meal routines.

        <p>
            Pulled pork mac and cheese is an upgrade to a classic food. The addition of protein and the barbecue sauce mixed with 
            traditional mac and cheese is such an amazing blend of flavors. It's also a simple recipe and you can't really go wrong.

        <h3><a href = "https://playswellwithbutter.com/short-rib-ragu-recipe/">Recipe 4: Short Rib Ragu</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is one of my favorite dishes of all time. Every time I'm at an Italian restaurant and this is on the menu, 
            it is a must get for me. This recipe also does a great job at replicating the restaurant quality food that I have
            had in the past. Just look at the picture, doesn't it look irresistible?

        <p>
            Yet another classic for you guys to give a try. It's a nice, healthy dish and quite easy to prepare. You can't go
            wrong with a chicken pot pie (I hope)!
