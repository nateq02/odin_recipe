This is my first project in HTML and CSS. For this project, I will be building a basic recipe website. This website consists of a main index page that contains links to recipes of 5 of my favorite foods. 

During this project, I learned a variety of different things, such as:

    - Different HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and lists
    
    - How to connect different web pages using links
    
    - How to style the elements that I created using CSS
    
    - How to navigate a GitHub repository and manage changes that I make to my own repositories
    
    - How to make my website accessible through GitHub
