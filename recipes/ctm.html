            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Chicken Tikka Masala is a new food that I've had and I really enjoyed it. For those of you that have not tried it yet,
                I think that it's a great Indian dish and has introduced me to Indian food in general. Definitely a great way to mix
                up you typical meal routines. This recipe creates a rich and creamy dish that can compete with Indian restaurants. 
                To further improve this recipe, try it with naan!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate 
                    for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in 
                    batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes 
                    on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up 
                    any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric 
                    and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally 
                    until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.
                <li>
                    Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for 
                    an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the 
                    water to thin out the sauce, if needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!
