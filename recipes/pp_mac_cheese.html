        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To cook pulled pork in an Instant Pot:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To your 6-quart Instant Pot add pork shoulder, yellow onion, and ginger ale.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set manual time for 75 minutes on high.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 75 minutes let the pulled pork NATURAL release.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pork should be tender and easily shreddable with a fork.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pull the pork roast out of the Instant Pot, add to a large plate and shred with two forks. If there are any large 
                    chunks of fat just throw them away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour out the juice from the Instant Pot and add shredded pork back to the Instant Pot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add in 1 cup BBQ sauce and stir.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add more BBQ sauce if desired or needed. You want the meat to be coated but not dripping with sauce. Cover to keep 
                    warm while you prepare the mac and cheese.
                </li>
            </ol>

                <li>

                <li>
                    Add macaroni and cheese to the prepared dish and top with pulled pork. Sprinkle on a little extra cheese if desired.
                </li>
